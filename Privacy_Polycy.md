# Privacy Policy

Last Modified: September 12, 2016

[A description of the app]

When you use these services—and any others we roll out—you’ll inevitably share some information with us. We get that that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.

That’s why we’ve written this privacy policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our privacy policy, just contact us.

## Information We Collect

There are three basic ways we collect information:

1. Information you choose to give us.
2. Information we get when you use our services.
2. Information we get from third parties.

Here's a little more detail on each of these categories.

### Information You Choose to Give Us

When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose
to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a 
basic USCFUN account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, 
such as: a username you’d like to go by, a password, an email address,
a phone number.
To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with
some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services,
such as profile pictures, or other useful identifying information.

Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the
services, such as posters, comments and messages to your friends. 
Keep in mind that the users you send messages and any other content to 
can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common
sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to USCFUN as well: 
Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or 
share.

### Information We Get When You Use Our Services

When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services
you’ve used and how you’ve used them. 

* Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our
services. For example, we may collect information about: how you interact with
the services, such as which poster you view or apply to USCFUN; 
how you communicate with other users, such as their names, the time and
date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your
friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your
interactions with posters. 

* Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the
hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, 
unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type,
language, wireless network, and mobile network information
(including the mobile phone number). 

* Device Phonebook. Because USCFUN is all about hanging out students from
University of Southern California, we may—with your consent—collect information
from your device’s phonebook.

* Location Information. When you use our services we may collect information
about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about
your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks,
cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and compasses.

* Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.
Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other
technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising
identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or
device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect
the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we
use cookies and your choices, please check out our Cookie Statement.

### Information We Collect from Third Parties

We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our
services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from
their device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the
information we collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have
collected about you. 


### How We Use Information

What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: 
provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly
improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:

* develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and 
services
* communicate with you
* monitor and analyze trends and usage
* personalize the services by, among other things, customizing the content we show you
* enhance the safety and security of our products and services
* verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity
* use information we’ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance
the services and your experience with them enforce our Terms of Service and other
usage polices
* We may also store some information locally on your device. For example,
we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view
content faster.

### How We Share Information

We may share information about you in the following ways:

* With other users. We may share the following information with other Users:
information about you, such as your username, profile picture and other
information that will help users understand your connections with others
using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new
friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you
and the requestor have USCFUN friends in common;
any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example,
when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you
with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook.

* With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if
we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
  + comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law,
    rule, or regulation; investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;
  + protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others;
  + detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns. 
  
### Information You Choose to Share with Third Parties

The services may also contain third-party links and search results, 
include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded
service that’s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to
those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or
third-party-branded service, you may be providing information 
(including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both.
You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third
parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review
the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or
use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.

## Control over Your Information

We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.

* Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and update most of the
personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the
requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons,
including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users,
requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, 
is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic
account information right in the app by visiting the app’s Settings page.
If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that
we may have, you can put in a request here. Because your privacy is important
to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information
before we let you access or update your personal information.

* Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to
collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, 
such as your phonebook and location services, you can simply revoke your consent
by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options.
Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.

* Account Deletion. While we hope you’ll remain a lifelong user, if for some
reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here. 
If you ask to delete your account, you will have up to 30 days to 
restore your account before we delete your information from our servers. 
During this period of time, your account will not be visible to other users.

### Users Outside the United States

Although we welcome users from all over the world, keep in mind that no
matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, we operate our
services from the United States. This means that we may collect your personal
information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States
and other countries whose local data-protection and privacy laws may offer
fewer protections than those in your country of residence or from any country
where you use or access the services.

### Children

Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 13.
And that’s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone
under 13.

### Revisions to the Privacy Policy

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let
you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date
at the top of the privacy policy that’s available on our website and mobile
application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice
(such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an
in-app notification).
